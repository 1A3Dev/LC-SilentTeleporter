### Information

This mod makes it so that people being teleported back to the ship have no indication of the teleport occuring by removing the particles and sound effects that occur before the teleportation happens.

_Note: The particles and sound effects are only removed from the normal teleporter since there isn't really any point in removing it from the inverse teleporter._
